    <h1>How My First Personal Project Started</h1>
        <p>On my very first project i really experience a lot of difficulties most expecially with my Laptop and the light
        in our area.</p>
        <p>My system wasn't that good and it was working very slowly that i almost cry out,besides the light at our area was
        very bad that hardly will i see electricity to charge for about a month and even whenever i plan of starting
        html light wasn,t always enough to charge my system.</p>
        <p>Talking of the network or data usage my wifi isn't connecting with my laptop which makes my network really bad
        </p>
        <P>In conclusion,my personal programming life started that way and am hoping and begging God for better things ahead
        in Jesus Name</P>
